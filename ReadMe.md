[Susan Li's](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-logistic-regression-in-python-step-by-step-becd4d56c9c8) was very helpful especially the section about the [SMOTE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.1813.pdf) algorith which as sampling technique which helps when dealing with imbalanced datasets like this one.
